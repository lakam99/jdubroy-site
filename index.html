            <h3>Business For Sale</h3>
            <p>When the time comes to sell your business, JAMES R. DUBROY LTD, Business Brokerage, prides itself on its
              ability to provide you, the business owner, with the peace of mind that all issues can be handled
              effectively, skillfully and confidentially.</p>
            <div class="more-content" id="content-1">
              <p>We have been helping business owners sell businesses for nearly 30 years.
                <br /><br />
                During this time, as an experienced and effective business broker, we have discretely advised business
                owners on the pricing of their business, dealing with customers, employees, competitors and others who
                usually do not have a need to know, structuring a transaction for best results, and other such related
                matters.
                <br /><br />
                As with business intermediary services or real estate brokerage, to provide business brokerage services
                in Ontario, one must be registered under the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act 2002, or be a
                practising attorney providing a legal service.
                <br /><br />
                JAMES R. DUBROY LTD focuses on Ottawa, eastern Ontario and western Quebec and has assisted business
                owners sell their companies and/or business operations in virtually all sectors of the economy including
                the resource, manufacturing and service sectors.
                <br /><br />
                We take pride – and are sure our clients will attest to this assertion – in putting the best interest of
                our clients first and foremost.
                <br /><br />
                We understand we cannot be of assistance to all business owners who wish to sell their company and/or
                business. If you have a substantive business located in eastern Ontario or western Quebec and wish to
                consider selling the company and/or business, it would be our pleasure to speak with you on a
                no-obligation and totally confidential basis. Should you decide to sell your company and/or business,
                the buyer might already be in our active buyer file and/or we can discretely and confidentially
                undertake a systematic search for buyer candidates.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to business brokerage, we also offer business intermediary services, business valuation and
                appraisal services, real estate brokerage, and business and management consulting.

            <h3>Business Intermediary Services</h3>
            <p>Business intermediary services involve acting between or amongst parties buying and selling a business,
              who typically know each other, to bring about a successful reconciliation of the differing economic and
              other interests of the parties.</p>
            <div class="more-content" id="content-2">
              <p>The parties might be competitors, suppliers, co-shareholders, family members and/or employees, or most
                frequently, the management team of a company. Although the underlying process is invariably dynamic and
                the players and issues differ, the ultimate the form of a successful and effective reconciliation
                remains relatively constant from case-to-case.
                <br /><br />
                As with business brokerage services, to provide business intermediary services in Ontario, one must be
                registered under the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act 2002, or be a practising attorney providing a
                legal service.
                <br /><br />
                Over the last three decades, JAMES R. DUBROY LTD, a business intermediary and business brokerage
                boutique, has been involved in a number of management buy-outs and has often been engaged to provide
                service where:
                <br /><br />
                the parties to the transaction already knew each other
                and/or
                <br /><br />
                the discussions were already underway,
                but there was a need for an experienced third-party to guide and advise on the process, handle the
                negotiations, and structure and document the transaction.
                <br /><br />
                A closely related service offered by JAMES R. DUBROY LTD is business brokerage, which service involves
                assisting parties generally buy and sell businesses.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to business intermediary services and business brokerage, we also offer business valuation
                and appraisal services, real estate brokerage, and business and management consulting.

            <h3>Real Estate Brokerage</h3>
            <p>Buying or selling a company and/or business often involves a real estate transaction.

              The real estate can include industrial, commercial, recreational, residential, agricultural, natural
              resource based properties, or special-use properties such as churches, cemeteries or government property.
            </p>
            <div class="more-content" id="content-3">
              <p>The transaction might involve buying, selling, leasing or renting real estate, or on occasion, a
                combination of these activities.
                <br /><br />
                As a duly registered real estate and business brokerage under Ontario’s Real Estate and Business Brokers
                Act 2002, JAMES R. DUBROY LTD has been assisting parties for nearly 30 years acquire or dispose of real
                estate either as part of buying or selling a company and/or business, or as a stand-alone transaction.
                As a result, as a real estate broker, we bring extensive experience, knowledge, skill and seasoned
                insight to each real estate transaction in which we are involved.
                <br /><br />
                Although we generally focus on Ottawa and eastern Ontario, we have assisted parties with their real
                estate needs and requirements throughout Ontario, across the country, and in the USA.

                In addition to real estate brokerage services, we also offer business brokerage, business intermediary

            <h3>Business Valuation</h3>
            <p>Business valuation is a process of determining the economic value of ownership interest in a business.

              The process is also sometimes referred to as business appraisal, or company valuation or company
              appraisal.

              Business valuations are conducted for any number of reasons</p>
            <div class="more-content" id="content-4">
              <p>including determining a price to offer to buy or to sell a business and to determine value in
                shareholder disputes, matrimonial breakdown, and in tax and/or succession planning.
                <br /><br />
                The value to be determined, be it for instance fair market value or fair value, is largely a function of
                the purpose of the business or company valuation or appraisal.
                <br /><br />
                The interest being valued might represent 100% of the ownership of a business or a company, as a whole,
                or it may constitute a lesser proportion such as in the case of a minority interest.
                <br /><br />
                The choice of many lawyers and accountants in eastern Ontario, JAMES R. DUBROY LTD, is a business
                brokerage boutique that offers theoretically sound, market-based valuation and consulting services. The
                firm is headed by its founder James Dubroy.
                <br /><br />
                James, a Certified Management Consultant, has a degree in economics and political science and has
                completed the multi-year, rigorous program of study of Canada’s pre-eminent and
                internationally-affiliated business valuation organization.
                <br /><br />
                Trained in formal valuation theory (concepts, principles, approaches and techniques) and with nearly 30
                years of experience in business brokerage – the buying and selling of companies and business operations
                – James brings a wealth of knowledge, skill, experience and special insight to business valuation
                engagements.

            <h3>Business and Management Consulting</h3>
            <p>Sometimes it’s strategy. Sometimes it’s execution.

              Frequently it’s both.

              Sometimes a challenge, or sometimes an opportunity.

              What is often required, however, is a certified business and management advisor whose experience,
              knowledge and integrity can be trusted.</p>
            <div class="more-content" id="content-5">
              <p>Through decades of consulting to business and governments, James Dubroy, the head of JAMES R. DUBROY
                LTD and a Certified Management Consultant (CMC), has developed and exhibits a wealth of experience and
                knowledge in business and management and constantly strives for integrity and professionalism.
                <br /><br />
                The Certified Management Consultant designation is the profession’s only international certification
                mark, recognized in over 40 countries. It represents a commitment to the highest standards of consulting
                and personal and professional ethics.
                <br /><br />
                James’ consulting career started shortly after university graduation working as an analyst with an
                economic consulting firm. He was then engaged by an industry-government advisory board to assist with a
                study of the transfer of technology from government to the private sector. In government, James was an
                advisor on government procurement and contracting policy, and for several years, a Senior Officer with
                the Treasury Board of Canada.
                <br /><br />
                Since returning to the private sector, James has consulted to international governments and extensively
                with numerous individual businesses.
                <br /><br />
                In addition to various business valuation assignments, projects with small to mid-sized enterprises have
                included developing a multifaceted pricing policy for a project management firm in the construction
                industry; succession planning with a number of family-run enterprises; developing detailed operating and
                capital budgets for a not-for-profit, start-up in a highly regulated industry, and integration plans,
                guidance and advice for firms coming together through acquisition or merger.
                <br /><br />
                Government funds are available to help small to mid-sized firms in Canada that need business or

              <p>It is illegal in most jurisdictions in Canada, for a party to broker and/or represent a buyer or seller
                in the purchase and sale of a privately-held business, unless the party is a specifically registered
                under provincial legislation to perform such services, or a practising attorney providing a legal

            <button class="faq-question">How to choose the right business brokerage or business intermediary?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In all professions, there are generalists and there are those who focus.
                <br /><br />
                In business brokerage or with business intermediary services, generalists tend to list any type or size
                of business and are often franchises or residential real estate agencies that also list small businesses
                for sale. In either case, a generalist’s website will typically reveal an array of small or marginal
                businesses for sale.
                <br /><br />
                Brokerages that focus tend to concentrate on a particular size or type of business. The higher the level
                of focus, the greater the expertise.
                <br /><br />
                JAMES R. DUBROY LTD, a business brokerage boutique, has focused for nearly three decades in providing
                highly customized service to owners of substantive business operations located for the most part in
                eastern Ontario and western Quebec. Buyers of course can be from anywhere, though, in most cases the
                buyer will be from the same geographical area or in the same field as the entity being sold.

            <button class="faq-question">Can anyone value or appraise a business or company?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>In theory, yes, anyone can value a business. Since ownership of a business often represents major or
                significant value to shareholders or business owners, it is best, however, to engage the services of an
                individual specifically trained in business valuation.

            <button class="faq-question">What about fees?</button>

              <p>Fees vary with the nature and scope of the engagement, and are as agreed on a case-by-case basis

              <ul>
                <li>1) Business brokerage or real estate brokerage fees are either a flat fee, or percentage commission,
                  or some combination of both, depending on the particulars of the undertaking.</li>
                <br />
                <li>2) Business intermediary and/or business valuation services are typically conducted on the basis of
                  a flat fee.</li>
                <br />
                <li>3) Business or management consulting assignments can be conducted on the basis of a unit rate (e.g.
                  hourly, daily, weekly) against achievement of pre-determined milestones, a fixed price contract,
                  and/or arranged as a success-based fee.</li>
